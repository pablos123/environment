# Environment

I love a fast, simple, clean, robust, versatile and automatized environment.

I'm using this set of tools since a lot of time and I don't think I will change them any time soon.

I resigned from the battle for visual consistency on Linux a long time ago, it is not worth it.

Probably I am using this on the latest version of _Linux Mint_.

# New machine

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/pablos123/environment' "${HOME}/environment"
bash "$HOME/environment/lib/initialize.sh"
```
