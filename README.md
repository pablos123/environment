# Environment

I consider this environment to be simple, stable and with a versatile configuration.

I am using this set of tools since a lot of time and I do not think I will change them any time soon.

I resigned from the battle for visual consistency a long time ago, it is not worth it.

I use the latest stable release of Debian headless.

# New machine

```bash
# root
bash <(curl --fail --silent --show-error --location https://example.com/postinstall-headless.sh)
exit
```
