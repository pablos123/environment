# Environment

I love a fast, simple, clean, robust, versatile and automatized environment.

I am using this set of tools since a lot of time and I don't think I will change them any time soon. **It just works.**

I code a lot and a lot is scripting. Some of that code survives and I use it in my environment, other goes to my [gits](https://gist.github.com/pablos123).

Probably I am using this on the latest version of _Linux Mint_.

\(Although, except for apt operations, this is probably distro agnostic.\)
