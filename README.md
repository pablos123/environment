# Environment
I consider this environment to be simple, stable and with a versatile configuration.

I'm using this set of tools since a lot of time and I don't think I will change them any time soon.

I resigned from the battle for visual consistency on Linux a long time ago, it is not worth it.

Probably I am using this on the latest version of _Linux Mint_.

# New machine
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/pablos123/environment' "${HOME}/environment"
bash "${HOME}/environment/lib/upgrade.sh"
```
