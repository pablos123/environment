# Environment

I consider this environment to be simple, stable and with a versatile configuration.

I am using this set of tools since a lot of time and I do not think I will change them any time soon.

I resigned from the battle for visual consistency a long time ago, it is not worth it.

I use the latest stable release of Debian headless.

After a fresh Debian headless install, run this as `root`:

With `root`:
```bash
bash <(wget --no-cache --no-cookies -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablos123/environment/refs/heads/main/bin/post_install)
```

With `pab`:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablos123/environment/refs/heads/main/bin/setup)
```
