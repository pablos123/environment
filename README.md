# Environment

I consider this environment to be simple, stable and with a versatile configuration.

I am using this set of tools since a lot of time and I do not think I will change them any time soon.

I resigned from the battle for visual consistency a long time ago, it is not worth it.

I use the latest stable release of Debian headless.

After a fresh Debian headless install, run this as `root`:

```bash
bash <(wget --quiet --output-document=- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablos123/environment/refs/heads/main/bin/post_install)
```

At the end the installer will tell me how to setup `pab` user.
