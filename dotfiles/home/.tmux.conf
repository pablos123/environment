# VTE terminals (GNOME terminal, XFCE terminal, Terminator) do not support the OSC 52 escape sequence.
# If I'm using a terminal multiplexer I'm going to be using st. No more to add.
# Read this when you are doubting again.
# Terminator is the best thing for not using a terminal multiplexer but I keep coming back
# to tmux. It seems that is something I want to use. Remember this.
# The only reason to not use a terminal multiplexer is to use a terminal that gie you
# all the features in the multiplexer. e.g Terminator. I say terminator because it works great, like non other.
# Another reason is to have img support for example, with wezterm and kitty, but I was using Terminator this
# past 4 months and that was not a problem.
# Wezterm also break neovim splitted windows, I hated that.
# Ghostty is not compiling with the last version of Zig.
# I can go back to using kitty at some point, but let's test st again.
