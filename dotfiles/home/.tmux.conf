# VTE terminals (GNOME terminal, XFCE terminal, Terminator) do not support the OSC 52 escape sequence.
# If I'm using a terminal multiplexer I'm going to be using st. No more to add.
# Read this when you are doubting again.
# Terminator is the best thing for not using a terminal multiplexer but I keep coming back
# to tmux. It seems that is something I want to use. Remember this.
# The only reason to not use a terminal multiplexer is to use a terminal that gie you
# all the features in the multiplexer. e.g Terminator. I say terminator because it works great, like non other.
# Another reason is to have img support for example, with wezterm and kitty, but I was using Terminator this
# past 4 months and that was not a problem. Because I works incredible well.
# A downside to Terminator is that it uses gtk. I don't mind having it installed but I try to avoid that.
# Wezterm also break neovim splitted windows, I hated that, it was a dissapointment.
# Ghostty is not compiling with the last version of Zig. Etc, all things that I hate.
# I can go back to using kitty at some point, but not in the short term.

# The tmux set-clipboard option was added in tmux 1.5 with a default of on;
# the default was changed to external when external was added in tmux 2.6.
# The difference is that on both makes tmux set the clipboard for the outside terminal,
# and allows applications inside tmux to set tmux's clipboard (adding a paste buffer).
# external only makes tmux set the clipboard and forbids applications inside from doing so.
